# Introduction:

A whole host of other services are running, including Kerberos. Kerberos is a key authentication service within Active Directory. With this port open, we can use a tool called Kerbrute (by Ronnie Flathers @ropnop) to brute force discovery of users, passwords and even password spray!

Note: Several users have informed me that the latest version of Kerbrute does not contain the UserEnum flag in Kerbrute, if that is the case with the version you have selected, try a older version!

Enumeration:

For this box, a modified User List and Password List will be used to cut down on time of enumeration of users and password hash cracking. It is NOT recommended to brute force credentials due to account lockout policies that we cannot enumerate on the domain controller.


```bash
./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d spookysec.local --dc AttacktiveDirectory.spookysec.local userlist.txt -o kerbrute-userenum.out
```

- What command within Kerbrute will allow us to enumerate valid usernames?

```bash
userenum
```

- What notable account is discovered? (These should jump out at you)

```bash
svc-admin
```

- What is the other notable account is discovered? (These should jump out at you)

```bash
backup
```
