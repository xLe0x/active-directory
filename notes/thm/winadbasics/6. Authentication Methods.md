Windows domains use **Domain Controllers** to store and verify user credentials. Two main protocols are used for network authentication in Windows domains:

- **Kerberos**: Default and recommended authentication protocol for recent versions of Windows.
- **NetNTLM**: Legacy protocol, still used for compatibility reasons.

While NetNTLM is obsolete, both protocols are typically enabled in most networks. Below is a breakdown of how each protocol works.

## 1. Kerberos Authentication

Kerberos is the default authentication protocol for Windows domains. The process involves **tickets** as proof of authentication, allowing users to access services without repeatedly sending their credentials.

### Kerberos Authentication Flow:
1. **Initial Authentication**:
   - The user sends their **username** and a **timestamp** encrypted with a key derived from their password to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, typically installed on the Domain Controller.
	   
1. **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**:
   - The KDC creates and sends back a **TGT**, which allows the user to request additional tickets for specific services. Along with the TGT, the user receives a **Session Key** for future requests.
   - The TGT is encrypted with the **krbtgt** account’s password hash, making its contents inaccessible to the user.

2. **Service Ticket Request (TGS)**:
   - To access a specific service (like a file share or database), the user sends the **TGT**, **username**, **timestamp**, and **Service Principal Name (SPN)** (which identifies the target service) to the KDC.
   - The KDC returns a **TGS** (Ticket Granting Service) and a **Service Session Key**.

3. **Service Authentication**:
   - The user sends the **TGS** to the service, which uses its account password hash to decrypt the ticket and validate the **Service Session Key** to authenticate the user.

### Kerberos Authentication Diagram:
- Step 1: User requests TGT from the KDC.
- Step 2: User requests TGS from KDC for a specific service.
- Step 3: User sends TGS to the service to authenticate.

## 2. NetNTLM Authentication

NetNTLM works through a **challenge-response** mechanism and is used for legacy systems or compatibility.

### NetNTLM Authentication Flow:
1. The client sends an **authentication request** to the server.
2. The server generates a **random challenge** and sends it to the client.
3. The client **combines their NTLM password hash** with the challenge to generate a response and sends it back to the server.
4. The server forwards the challenge and response to the **Domain Controller** for verification.
5. The Domain Controller **recalculates the response** using the challenge and compares it with the client’s response.
   - If the responses match, the client is authenticated.
   - If not, access is denied.

6. The server sends the authentication result to the client.

### Key Point:
- **Passwords** or their **hashes** are never transmitted across the network for security purposes.
- If a **local account** is used, the server verifies the response using the locally stored password hash in the **SAM (Security Accounts Manager)**, without involving the Domain Controller.

## Conclusion:
- **Kerberos** is the preferred authentication method for modern Windows domains.
- **NetNTLM** is considered legacy but may still be present in networks for compatibility.
