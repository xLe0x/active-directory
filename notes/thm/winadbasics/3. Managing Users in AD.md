## 1. **Deleting Extra OUs and Users**
   - **Identifying Extra OU**: There is an additional OU that doesn't match the organisational chart. This OU needs to be deleted as it was closed due to budget cuts.
   
   - **Deleting the OU**:
     - By default, OUs are protected against accidental deletion.

     - Enable **Advanced Features** in the **View** menu to access additional containers and disable deletion protection.
     - Right-click the OU > **Properties** > **Object tab** > Uncheck **Protect object from accidental deletion**.
     - Confirm the deletion, which will also remove any users, groups, or sub-OUs within it.

   - **Synchronizing Users**: After deleting the extra OU, check the users within the remaining OUs and ensure they match the organizational chart. Create or delete users as needed.

## 2. **Delegation of Control**
   - **Delegating Control**: One key feature of AD is the ability to delegate specific control of an OU to non-admin users. For example, Phillip from IT support should be able to reset passwords for users in the **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **Management** OUs.
   
   - **Delegating Password Reset Control**:
     - Right-click on the **Sales OU** > **Delegate Control**.
     - Add **Phillip** by typing his username and clicking **Check Names**.
     - Select **Delegate control of password resets** and complete the wizard.
     - Phillip can now reset passwords for users in the Sales department.

## 3. **Testing Delegated Control**
   - **Using Phillip’s Credentials**:
     - Log in via RDP using **THM\phillip** and password **Claire2008**.
     - Phillip does not have ADUC privileges, so password resets will be done via **PowerShell**.
   
   - **Resetting a User’s Password**:
     - Use the following PowerShell command to reset Sophie's password:

       ```powershell
Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose
       ```
   
   - **Forcing a Password Reset on Next Logon**:
     - Run the following command to force a password reset at Sophie's next logon:
       ```powershell
Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie -Verbose
       ```
