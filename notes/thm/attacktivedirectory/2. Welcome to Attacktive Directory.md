# Enumeration

Basic enumeration starts out with an nmap scan, it cannot enumerate everything. Therefore after an initial nmap scan we'll be using other utilities to help us enumerate the services running on the device.

Notes: Flags for each user account are available for submission. You can retrieve the flags for user accounts via RDP (Note: the login format is spookysec.local\User at the Window's login prompt) and Administrator via Evil-WinRM.
