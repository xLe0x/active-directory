## Introduction

When managing a small network with only a few computers, you can configure each machine individually. However, as a business grows (e.g., 157 computers and 320 users across multiple offices), manually managing each computer becomes impractical. This is where a **Windows domain** comes into play.

A Windows domain is a group of users and computers managed centrally through **Active Directory (AD)**. The server running AD services is known as the **Domain Controller (DC)**.

## Advantages of a Windows Domain

1. **Centralized Identity Management**:
   - Users and computers are managed from a single point, Active Directory.
   
2. **Managing Security Policies**:
   - Security policies can be applied across the network, ensuring consistency in access control and user settings.
   
3. **Simplified Administration**:
   - Policies and settings can be deployed across multiple systems without the need for on-site configuration.

## Real-World Example

In educational networks (like schools or universities), you typically use the same credentials to log into any computer on campus. This is made possible by Active Directory, which stores and manages the credentials for all machines. AD also allows administrators to set policies, such as restricting access to control panel settings, which limits user privileges.

## Task Overview: THM Inc.

As the new IT admin at **THM Inc.**, your first task is to review the current domain **"THM.local"** and perform additional configurations. You will have administrative credentials to a pre-configured Domain Controller (DC) to complete the task.
