# Introduction

After the enumeration of user accounts is finished, we can attempt to abuse a feature within Kerberos with an attack method called ASREPRoasting. ASReproasting occurs when a user account has the privilege "Does not require Pre-Authentication" set. This means that the account does not need to provide valid identification before requesting a Kerberos Ticket on the specified user account.

# Retrieving Kerberos Tickets (TGS)

Impacket has a tool called "GetNPUsers.py" (located in impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py) that will allow us to query ASReproastable accounts from the Key Distribution Center. The only thing that's necessary to query accounts is a valid set of usernames which we enumerated previously via Kerbrute.

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers -no-pass -usersfile userlist.txt spookysec.local/
```

- We have two user accounts that we could potentially query a ticket from. Which user account can you query a ticket from with no password?

```bash
svc-admin
```

- Looking at the Hashcat Examples Wiki page, what type of Kerberos hash did we retrieve from the KDC? (Specify the full name)

```bash
Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 23
```

- What mode is the hash?

```bash
18200
```

- Now crack the hash with the modified password list provided, what is the user accounts password?

```bash
management2005
```
