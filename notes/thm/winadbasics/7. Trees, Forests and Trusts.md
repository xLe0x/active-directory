# Trees, Forests, and Trusts in Active Directory

As companies grow, their networks need to scale. Initially, a single domain might be sufficient, but as organizational needs increase, the structure of the network may evolve to include multiple domains. Below is a breakdown of how **Trees**, **Forests**, and **Trusts** work in Active Directory (AD).

## 1. Single Domain

When a company is small or just starting, it might only need a **single domain** to manage users, computers, and resources. However, as the company grows, the need for a more complex network structure arises.

## 2. Trees

A **Tree** in Active Directory is a collection of domains that share a common root domain name, and can be structured to represent different regions, teams, or units within an organization.

### Example:
- **Root domain**: thm.local
- **Subdomains**: uk.thm.local, us.thm.local

In this scenario, both the **UK** and **US** branches would each have their own Domain Controller (DC), managing resources specific to their regions. The IT teams in each region can manage resources independently.

### Benefits:
- Independent management of each domain's resources.
- IT administrators have control over their respective regions.
- Different **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** can be applied to each domain.
  
### Administrative Structure:
- **Domain Admins**: Have administrative control over their specific domain.
- **Enterprise Admins**: Have administrative control over all domains in the enterprise, including all subdomains.

## 3. Forests

A **Forest** is a collection of multiple **trees** that might have different namespaces. This is often seen when companies merge, each with its own domain and IT management.

### Example:
- Company 1: thm.local
- Company 2: mht.local

The union of these separate domain trees into a single network forms a **forest**.

### Benefits:
- Multiple trees can exist in the same forest, each with its own namespace.
- Provides centralized management across different domains.

## 4. Trust Relationships

Trust relationships allow different domains within a tree or forest to share resources securely. A **trust relationship** enables one domain to authenticate users and grant access to resources in another domain.

### Types of Trusts:
- **One-Way Trust**: If Domain AAA trusts Domain BBB, a user in BBB can access resources in AAA, but not vice versa.

- **Two-Way Trust**: Both domains mutually trust each other, allowing users from either domain to access resources in the other.

### Important Notes:
- A trust relationship does not automatically grant full access to all resources. After establishing the trust, access needs to be authorized for each resource individually.
- By default, domains within a tree or forest have **two-way trust**.

### Example:
- **THM UK** trusts **MHT ASIA** to allow access to shared files. 

## Conclusion:
- **Trees** allow better management of domains with shared namespaces.
- **Forests** bring together multiple trees with different namespaces.
- **Trust relationships** facilitate secure access between domains within a tree or across forests, but access must be explicitly granted.
