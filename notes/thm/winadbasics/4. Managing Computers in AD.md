## 1. **Understanding the Default "Computers" Container**
   - By default, all machines that join the domain (except Domain Controllers) are placed in the "Computers" container.
   - In our current setup, we can see several devices (servers, laptops, PCs) placed here.

## 2. **Why Segregate Machines?**
   - Machines should be segregated based on their role in the network to allow for different policies to be applied to each category:
     1. **Workstations**: Devices used by regular users for their daily tasks (e.g., browsing, office work).
     2. **Servers**: Machines providing services to users or other servers, such as file servers or database servers.
     3. **Domain Controllers**: Machines that manage the Active Directory domain and contain sensitive data, including hashed passwords for all user accounts.

## 3. **Creating New OUs for Workstations and Servers**
   - To better manage these devices, create two new Organizational Units (OUs) directly under the **thm.local** domain:
     - **Workstations OU**: For personal computers and laptops used by regular users.
     - **Servers OU**: For the servers in the domain.
   
   - **Final OU Structure**:
     ```
     thm.local
     ├── Workstations
     └── Servers
     ```

## 4. **Moving Machines to the Appropriate OUs**
   - Move the personal computers and laptops from the "Computers" container to the **Workstations OU**.
   - Move the servers from the "Computers" container to the **Servers OU**.
   
   - This segregation allows for applying specific group policies tailored for each category of machines.

## 5. **Conclusion**
   - After the segregation, you can create and apply policies specific to workstations, servers, and domain controllers as needed. This organization improves manageability and security.
