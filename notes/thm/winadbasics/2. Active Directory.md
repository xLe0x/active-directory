The **Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)** is the core component of any Windows domain. It acts as a centralized catalogue that holds information about "objects" in the network, including users, groups, machines, printers, shares, and more.

## Key Objects in Active Directory

### 1. **Users**
   - **Security Principals**: Users are considered security principals, meaning they can be authenticated by the domain and assigned privileges.
   - **Types of Users**:
     - **People**: Represent employees who need network access.
     - **Services**: Represent users for services like IIS or MSSQL (service users have limited privileges).

### 2. **Machines**
   - Machines (computers) also exist as objects within AD. When a computer joins the domain, a machine object is created.
   - Machine accounts have local administrator rights on the assigned computer but are generally not accessed by anyone except the machine itself.
   - **Naming convention**: Machine accounts are named with the computer name followed by a dollar sign (e.g., `DC01$`).

### 3. **Security Groups**
   - Security groups are used to assign access rights to resources, allowing for easier management (i.e., groups of users inherit privileges).
   - **Examples of Default Security Groups**:
     - **Domain Admins**: Administrative privileges over the entire domain.
     - **Server Operators**: Administer Domain Controllers but cannot modify administrative group memberships.
     - **Backup Operators**: Access to all files for backups.
     - **Account Operators**: Create or modify accounts in the domain.
     - **Domain Users**: All user accounts in the domain.
     - **Domain Computers**: All machines in the domain.
     - **Domain Controllers**: All DCs in the domain.

### 4. **Active Directory Users and Computers**
   - To configure users, groups, or machines, use the **Active Directory Users and Computers** tool on the Domain Controller.
   - **Organizational Units (OUs)**: These are used to classify users and machines for policy application. OUs mimic the organizational structure (e.g., Sales, IT, Management).
   - **Default Containers**:
     - **Builtin**: Default groups available to any Windows host.
     - **Computers**: Machines joining the domain are placed here by default.
     - **Domain Controllers**: Contains the Domain Controllers.
     - **Users**: Default users and groups for domain-wide context.
     - **Managed Service Accounts**: Service accounts used within the domain.

### 5. **Security Groups vs OUs**
   - **OUs**: Used for applying policies to users and computers based on their roles (e.g., department policies). A user can only belong to one OU at a time.
   - **Security Groups**: Used to grant permissions over resources (e.g., shared folders, printers). A user can belong to multiple groups for access to various resources.
